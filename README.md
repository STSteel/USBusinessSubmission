This reports is based on a study of business and industry trends in the United States 
using the US Census Bureau data.
The inspiration for this study is the hypothesis that US National level of value generation,
as an indication of economic optimism, drives the antecipation of new property demand. 
The analysis looks for regional variations in the US and attempts to predict the regional 
growth of new home construction and sales.
