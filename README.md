# US Economic Report

This project is based on a study of business and industry trends in the United States 
using the US Census Bureau data.
The inspiration for this study is the hypothesis that US National level of value generation,
as an indication of economic optimism, drives the antecipation of new property demand, therefore
new housing activity.
The analysis looks for industry variations in the US and time lags between income and new housing
activities and attempts to predict the regional growth of new home construction and sales.
